# Zeidan — Personal Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio site built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Files
- `index.html` — page structure (semantic tags: header, nav, main, section, article, footer)
- `style.css` — all styling, including responsive media queries
- `script.js` — mobile nav toggle and contact form validation

## Before you submit / deploy
Replace the placeholder content with your own:
- [ ] About Me text — your real bio
- [ ] Skills — your actual tools and confidence level
- [ ] Projects (U1, U2, U3) — real projects, with working links to live demos or GitHub repos
- [ ] Contact form — connect it to a real service (see note below) or your email
- [ ] Footer links — your real GitHub, LinkedIn, and email

## Running it locally
No build step needed — just open `index.html` in a browser, or use a local server:

```bash
cd portfolio
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Making the contact form actually send messages
Right now the form validates input (name, email, message) but doesn't send anywhere —
that needs a backend. The easiest options for a static GitHub Pages site:
- **Formspree** (formspree.io) — add your form endpoint as the `action` attribute
- **EmailJS** (emailjs.com) — send email directly from JavaScript, no backend needed
- **Netlify Forms** — if you deploy to Netlify instead of GitHub Pages

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio site"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
git push -u origin main
```

Then on GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Source → Deploy from branch → main → / (root) → Save**.

Your site will be live at:
`https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
